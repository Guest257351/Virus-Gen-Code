all scripts must start with:
```
set number=1
< run.sav (
  set /p number=
)

set update=1
if %number% equ %update% (payload.bat)
```

all scripts must end with:
```
echo %update%>run.sav
payload.bat
```
change the 1 in where it says
```set update=1```
to anything else every time you update the code
not doing so will mean your code wont run
