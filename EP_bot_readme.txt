READ ALL OF THIS CAREFULLY


IMPORTANT:
for this bot to work you NEED your screen resolution to be set to 1366 x 768, you can change this in settings.


What the bot will do:
read text off your screen using software called textract
access your keyboard to type answers
output text that was read, answers, and a timestamp into a log file
some text files will be created to store data

What the bot can do:
it can solve EP math skill lists that contain only the 4 basic operations (+ - * /)
it can solve decimals and questions including brackets () aswell
it can automaticaly go to the next page in a skill list

What the bot can't do:
it can not solve questions that are not EP math skill lists
it can not solve questions that involve symbols not mentioned above, this includes but not limited too: fractions, Algebra, Percentages.
it can not solve your english and science homework, however I am working on a bot that can.
it can not work without a human watching it and telling it what skill lists to solve. So you cannot leave it running overnight.

What you shouldn't do:
change tabs/windows while the bot is running (the bot is constantly using your keyboard and wont stop when you change tabs, if you want to change windows pause or close the bot first)
leave the bot unsupervised
give the bots questions it cannot solve

What you should do:
give the bots questions it can solve
change the skill list when it finishes a skill list
pause the bot before switching skill lists (left click anywhere inside the CMD window to pause and right click to unpause)

Instructions:
Math skill lists are like flash cards also known as mental maths.
Almost all of them can be found here: https://www.educationperfect.com/app/#/dashboard/maths/content/2616650
You can recognise skill lists by their purple Icon. Here is an image of the icon: http://bit.ly/EP_icon
The lists that are verified as working by the bot can be found under folders 1, 2, 3, and 5. however other lists may contains solvable questions
once you click on a skill list do not click start, instead start the bot and the bot will click start for you
skill lists have multiple sections/pages, the bot automaticaly switches to a new page once one is complete
when the bot finishes all the pages in a skill list, pause the bot, start a new skill list, and unpause the bot
rinse and repeat


IMPORTANT TEXTRACT INFO:
textract (the software used to read the question off the screen) is not free. It comes with a 40 day free trial.
However I have created my own crack for it which is inside the install directory (crack.bat)
run this if the freetrial ends.
NOTE: you will see like a million error messages, ignore these.


What is "division mode":
Because of the similarities between the addition and division symobols textract reads both of them as +
turning on division mode will turn any + symbol into a /
this means you cannot do division and addition at the same time
if you want to dissable division mode then you need to restart the app, the same goes for enabling it.
